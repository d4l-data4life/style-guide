== Writing the {compname} company name

Use the {compname} company name in the following ways:

[horizontal]

{compname}:: Use this version for most content.

{compname-short}:: Avoid this short version, unless you absolutely must use it for space reasons, or if it's displayed on the user interface (UI).

{compname-legal}:: Use the full legal name in the company address, in legal content, and in copyright information.

Don't use apostrophes with brand names and product names, for example, in possessives and contractions.

((&#10006;)) {compname}'s Analytics Platform

((&#10004;)) {compname} Analytics Platform

((&#10006;)) Apple's developer tools

((&#10006;)) {compname}'s committed to the privacy-by-design approach.



== Main writing principles

At {compname}, use the following software industry best practices for your documentation.

=== Use American English

Because we write for an international audience, write documentation for developers and end users in American English.
Many users who aren't native English speakers read our content.
Keep in mind that our content will be translated into other languages.
This is typically done by a localization agency or by international users with computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools.

Be aware of different terms and spellings used in American English and British English.

((&#128065;)) See <<Different terms and spellings in American English and British English>> in the appendix.


=== Use the active voice

Use the active voice whenever you can.
The active voice asserts that the subject of the sentence is in action.
The passive voice asserts that the action is on the subject.

TIP: The passive voice may be used to avoid awkward sentences or to avoid giving the impression that you're blaming the users.
It's common to use passive voice in error messages, warnings, or notifications.


=== Focus on the user

Always focus on the user.
Users interact with digital solutions with a goal in mind.
Users want to do specific tasks and they have limited time.

((&#10004;)) The {compname} encrypted storage lets you securely store your health documents.

((&#10004;)) Use {compname} encrypted storage to securely store your health documents.

((&#10006;)) The Photos app on the iPhone has the capability to store health documents.

((&#10006;)) The {compname} app gives you the possibility to share health documents with your doctor.

=== Use short words and sentences for better readability

Readability describes how easy or hard it is for readers to understand text.
Short words and sentences are more readable than long words and sentences.

Use short, familiar words whenever possible.

Try to split sentences with more than 25 words. The average sentence length should be around 15 words.

=== Use contractions

Use common contractions, such as, it’s, you’re, that's, can't and don’t.
Contractions support the friendly and informal tone that represents {compname}.

=== Use the serial comma

Use the serial comma.
In English language punctuation, a serial comma is placed immediately before the coordinating conjunction (usually _and_ or _or_) in a series of 3 or more terms.
The serial comma is also called the Oxford comma.

((&#10004;)) This section covers identification, authentication, and authorization.

((&#10006;)) This section covers identification, authentication and authorization.

=== Directly address your readers

To establish a connection with the user, use the second person.
Write as though you're speaking to the user by using the personal pronoun _you_.
This style supports a friendly, human tone and helps avoid the passive voice.

((&#10004;)) Use the {compname} encrypted storage to securely store your health documents.

((&#10006;)) You can use the {compname} encrypted storage to securely store your health documents.

TIP: Avoid over-using auxiliary verbs. Consider omitting _you can_ whenever a sentence works without it.

=== Use the present tense

Use the present tense.
You can often rewrite future tense sentences without changing their meaning.

((&#10004;)) Send a query to the backend service. The server sends an acknowledgment.

((&#10006;)) Send a query to the backend service. The server will send an acknowledgment.

== Other writing guidelines

These guidelines also help you write clearly and to the point.

=== Use plain language

Write in plain language.
Plain language makes it easier for everyone to read and understand our communications, and use our products.

((&#128065;)) See link:https://plainlanguage.gov/[Official guidelines for the US Plain Writing Act]

((&#128065;)) See link:http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/[Plain English campaign in the UK]

((&#128065;)) See link:https://www.nala.ie/plain-english/[Plain English campaign in Ireland]


=== Check your texts with readability checkers

Use online readability tools to check your writing.
These tools score text based on word and sentence length.
Technical writing at {compname} aims for a Flesch reading ease score of 60 and higher.

((&#128065;)) See link:https://app.readable.com/text/?demo[ Readable]

((&#128065;)) See link:https://www.prepostseo.com/readability-checker[prepostseo Readability Score Checker]

=== Avoid the first person plural
Avoid the pronoun _we_ and phrases like "we recommend."
Write around it and keep the focus on the reader.
It's OK to use _we_ when you write for reuse and want to avoid mentioning the company name.
Don't refer to the user in different ways in the same sentence.

((&#10006;)) Change your preferences in *My profile*

=== Use nouns, not pronouns
Repeat a noun instead of using a backward-referring pronoun like _it_, _they_, _this_, or _these_.
Repeating the noun ensures that the reference is clear.

((&#10006;)) Remove the users from the group. Afterward, they cannot access the resource anymore.

((&#10004;)) Remove the users from the group. Afterward, the users cannot access the resource anymore.

=== Referring to special characters
Refer to special characters by their name when necessary. To refer to a special character, use the formulation _<character name> (<character symbol>)_.

((&#10004;)) Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard character in your search.

((&#10006;)) Use '*' as a wildcard character in your search.

((&#10006;)) The percent sign (%) saves space in tables.

((&#128065;)) See <<Names of common special characters and punctuation marks>> in the appendix.

=== Avoid the following styles and phrases

To avoid wordiness, fluff, and marketing style, use simple, common words and phrases.
The table gives examples of verbs or phrasing that you can simplify.
The full table in the appendix gives more examples.

// I added some aspects like and/or and or not. Maybe they should not be in this table, but elsewhere.

=== Formatting choices

Consistent use of fonts, text formatting, capitalization, and text alignment improves accessibility and readability.

Avoid over-formatting, for example, using bold formatting for keywords.
Bold format can improve scannability, but becomes tiring when used too often.
Use italics to emphasize words and reserve bold formatting for referring to user interface elements.

=== Using "that," "which," and "who" in relative clauses [[using-that-which-and-who-in-relative-clauses]]

In English, there are restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses.
Restrictive clauses aren't set off with commas because the relative clause is essential to the meaning.

NOTE: Restrictive clauses are also known as defining clauses.
And nonrestrictive clauses are also known as nondefining clauses.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Relative pronoun
|Type of relative clause
|((&#10004;)) Example

|that
|Restrictive (no commas)
|The backups that run weekly are triggered by the external backup tool.

[Note: This example implies that only weekly backups are triggered by the external tool.]

|which
|Nonrestrictive (with commas)
|The backups, which are run weekly, are triggered by an external backup tool.

[Note: This example implies that all backups are triggered by the external tool and that these are run weekly.]

.2+| who [for persons]
|Restrictive (no commas)
|My brother who lives in Berlin ... [Note: I have at least 2 brothers.]

|Nonrestrictive (with commas)
|My brother, who lives in Berlin, ... [Note: I have only 1 brother.]
|===

=== Using the word _please_

Avoid _please_ in instructional text and in cross-references.
It's OK to use _please_ in situations where users are asked to do something inconvenient.
Also use _please_ in user interface copy where the app or platform is to blame for the situation.

((&#10004;)) Follow the steps below.

((&#10006;)) Please follow the steps below.

((&#10004;)) Update your antivirus software immediately.

((&#10006;)) Please update your antivirus software immediately.



=== Avoid dangling modifiers
A dangling modifier is a phrase that, from a grammatical perspective, refers to the subject of a sentence but is actually intended to refer to a different noun.

Ensure your text doesn't contain dangling modifiers.

((&#10006;)) After scanning the document, the file is ready to share.

((&#10004;)) After you have scanned the document, the file is ready to share.

== Writing for an international audience

Writing in the international style means naturally and expressing yourself using standard international conventions.
When you write this way, you support the internationalization of your content.

=== Using international style

These are the basic rules for international style:

- Write in simple structures.
- Don’t use jargon, idioms, or colloquial expressions.
- Avoid shortcuts, symbols, and abbreviations that could easily be spelled out.

((&#10006;)) The UUID is then displayed in the UI next to the PIN number.

((&#10006;)) You can also use the CLI.

((&#10006;)) At the end of the day, our think-outside-the-box meeting brought everyone on the same page to create a great win-win situation for all key stakeholders to identify the low-hanging fruit.

((&#10006;)) Our technology stack is built around virtualization and containerization, with a high-availability baseline achieved using redundant nodes and providing a configuration both resilient and flexible to scale with the help of automation.

=== Avoid non-English words

Don't use Latin abbreviations.
Use the full English equivalent instead.

NOTE: Avoid the _via_ preposition unless you're writing about travel. The original meaning of the Latin word is: traveling through (a place) en route to a destination. For example, _I arrived in Manhattan via Newark_.

The table gives examples of non-English words and how to replace them.

|((&#10006;)) from the client to the server and vice versa

((&#10004;)) bidirectionally between the client and the server

|===

== Using abbreviations

Abbreviations can be unclear, especially for international audiences.
In some languages, abbreviations are uncommon.

Avoid abbreviations.
This ensures that their meaning is explicit.
Always spell out terms when they're short or when they're used only 2 or 3 times within a topic.

=== Introducing abbreviations

You may use abbreviations if they avoid text becoming tiring. Or if a spelled-out version is really long.

When you first mention a term, spell it out and write its abbreviated form in parentheses.
Use its abbreviated form thereafter.

((&#10004;)) hospital information system (HIS)

((&#10004;)) subject matter expert (SME)

((&#10004;)) HPI-Mount Sinai (HPIMS)

((&#10006;)) UX (user experience)

TIP: Don't introduce abbreviations in headings.

=== Numeronyms

Don't use numeronyms, unless you're writing for an expert audience, for example, the {compname} tech blog.
Numeronyms are jargon and unnecessary abbreviations.

((&#10006;)) a11y (for accessibility)

((&#10006;)) i18n (for internationalization)

=== Plural abbreviations

Never use an apostrophe to form a plural abbreviation.

((&#10006;)) PC's

((&#10006;)) RFC's

== Writing numbers

Be consistent with your use of numbers.
When you refer to numbers used in examples or on the user interface, duplicate them exactly as they're displayed on the user interface.

=== Numerals or words

In content that doesn't refer to the user interface, apply these guidelines:

- Write all numbers as numerals in headlines, body text, and in tables.

- Don't start a sentence with a numeral.
Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if you can't rewrite the sentence.

.*Content from the {compname} Brand team uses different rules for numbers*
NOTE: The rule to always use numerals instead of words does not apply to writing brand content at {compname}.
For brand content, spell out numbers from 0 through 9.
Use numerals for 10 and greater.

((&#10004;)) More than 70% of the Earth's surface is water.

((&#10004;)) The SSD has 2 TB of storage.


=== Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers indicate the place of an item in a sequence, such as _first_ or _second_.
Use ordinal numbers as follows:

- Always spell out ordinal numbers.
- Don't use ordinal numbers for dates.

((&#10004;)) The first column of the table

((&#10004;)) The twenty-first anniversary

((&#10006;)) The 1st rule is to use numerals.

((&#10006;)) June fifth 2020

=== Commas in numbers

Don't use commas in numbers.
In numbers of 5 or more digits, use a nonbreaking space (press option-space bar).
Breaking up large numbers makes them easier to read, especially in tables.
A nonbreaking space can’t be misinterpreted as a decimal marker.

((&#10004;)) 5000

((&#10004;)) 2492.7201

((&#10004;)) 20 000

((&#10004;)) Apple sold 3.7 million MacBook Pro computers in 2 years.

=== Percentages

Use the percent sign (%) in headlines and in body text, without a preceding space.
The percent sign saves space and makes your text more scannable.

((&#10004;)) 9% of our test users scanned every new page they came across. Only 16% read word by word.


=== Writing dates and times

==== Dates

In body text, capitalize the names of months and always spell them out to avoid ambiguity.
Only use abbreviations if space is extremely limited. Use a numeral for the day in dates.

Use the following format for dates:

- _month day, year_

((&#10004;)) July 31, 2019

((&#10006;)) 31 July 2019

((&#10006;)) 31/7/2019

NOTE: The positions of the month and day vary by country.
For example, 6/12/2017 might be June 12, 2017 or December 6, 2017.
Using the _month day, year_ format for dates avoids confusion.

TIP: When you refer to the user interface and in content for developers, it's OK to use numbers and slashes for dates if the code supports that format, for example, YYYY/MM/DD.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommends writing dates with numerals in year-month-day format, such as 2018-10-24.
This is useful when people need to convey information across international borders.
The version day-month-year is used by the United Nations when writing the full date format in official documents.
But for prose in American English, use the month-day-year format. And always use 4 digits for the year for clarity.

Omit the comma in partial dates. For example, when only giving the month and year.

((&#10004;)) I started working at {compname} in May 2019.

When you add the day of the week, use a comma.
When a date is in the middle of a sentence, add a comma after the year.

((&#10004;)) Monday, May 2, 2019, was my first day of work.



==== Times

Express the time of the day using the 24-hour clock.
Only use AM and PM when you describe a time displayed differently on the user interface or when you describe a feature that uses the 12-hour clock.
Write AM and PM in capital letters, without the period, and with a space before.

((&#10004;)) Our weekly executive meeting starts each Tuesday at 15:00.

Use this formatting when you must break the 24-hour clock rule.

((&#10004;)) Our weekly executive meeting starts each Tuesday at 3:00 PM.

Not all time zones have names, and some time-zone names are used in more than 1 geographical area.
If you're talking about a particular place, clarify the country or reference Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Don't include spaces around the plus sign (+) or hyphen (-).

((&#10004;)) Berlin (UTC+1)

((&#10004;)) Eastern Time (UTC+10)

((&#10004;)) UTC+02:00


==== Ranges of time

In text, use _to_ in a range of times.

((&#10004;)) Our core working hours are from 10:00 to 16:30.

((&#10004;)) Our core working hours are from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM. (exception if you must use AM and PM)

=== Days of the week and names of months

Capitalize the days of the week and the names of months.
Only use abbreviations when space is very limited.
In those circumstances, use these 3-letter abbreviations without a period:

[horizontal]

Days of the week:: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, and Sat
Months:: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, and Dec

== Units of measurement

Units of measurement are represented by the following symbols.
Write out the name of units in body text.
In tables, use the unit symbol.
Always use these symbols with numerals.

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===

=== Writing numerals with units of measurement

Use a space to separate the numerical value from the unit symbol.
These exceptions apply:

- Percent sign (%)

- Plus sign (+)

- Minus sign (-)

- Degree sign (°) when it refers to an angle or temperature

((&#10004;)) 106 mmol/dL

((&#10004;)) 95%

((&#10004;)) 42°C fever

=== Writing currencies

Express currency amounts with the 3-letter currency code.
Currency codes are specific to a currency and can’t be confused or misinterpreted by readers.
Currency symbols such as the dollar sign ($) aren’t unique and are easily misread.

International currency codes follow the ISO 4217 standard.

((&#10064;)) link:http:www.iso.org[International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]

Write the currency code in capitals followed by a space and the amount.

((&#10004;)) The computer is priced at USD 1234.

((&#10004;)) The computer costs EUR 1234.

((&#10004;)) The new car has a price of USD 29 999.

== Working with lists

Lists are a great way to present complex information in a way that's easy to scan.

Lists are helpful because they do the following:

- Highlight levels of importance
- Help readers understand the order in which things happen
- Help readers skim and scan
- Make it easy for readers to identify all steps in a process
- Add white space, improving readability
- Provide a good way to present items, conditions, and exceptions


=== Introducing lists

Follow these rules when you use lists:

- Ensure that the purpose of the list is clear in the heading and introduction.
- Introduce a list with a complete sentence that ends with a colon.
- Never use a partial sentence as a lead-in that's completed by the list items.

Avoid mentioning numbers in list introductions. This can cause issues when you add or remove entries to the list.

((&#10004;)) When you save your recovery key, you have the following options:

((&#10006;)) When you save your recovery key, you have the following 3 options:

=== Using capitalization and punctuation in lists

Use sentence case for list entries:

- Begin each entry in a bulleted or numbered list with a capital letter.
- If an entry is a complete sentence, end it with a period.
- If an entry is a fragment, don't end with a period.
- Avoid mixing fragments and full sentences in the same list by ensuring that all entries have a parallel structure.

=== Ensuring a parallel structure within lists

Make entries in lists parallel.
Parallelism means that entries with similar content have the same grammatical structure.
For example, each item should be a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

((&#10004;)) sing, dance, and shout

((&#10004;)) singing, dancing, and shouting

((&#10006;)) I like running, traveling, and to read.

=== Unordered lists

Use unordered lists – also called bulleted lists – for entries that have something in common but for which the sequence of items isn't important.


=== Numbered lists

Use a numbered list when you want to stress the sequential nature of steps, rules, or instructions.
In numbered task lists, make each step a complete sentence.
Use sentence-style capitalization for each item and end each item with closing punctuation.

((&#128065;)) See <<Writing task topics and procedures>>.

=== Capitalization after colons

For colons in a sentence, use these rules:

- If the colon is followed by a complete sentence, begin the first word with an uppercase letter.

- If the colon is followed by an incomplete sentence (a word or a phrase), begin the first word with a lowercase letter.


////
== List common mistakes?

- Word list from Microsoft style for DE
- Examples from CMOS 5.250, for example, and/or
- and/or: Guardian style guide says: about and/or – This is horrible. Make your mind up and say either “and” or “or” – whichever is more appropriate.
////

== Handling punctuation

=== Exclamation points

Use exclamation points sparingly. Save them for when emphasis is most necessary.

((&#10004;)) Don't call exclamation points exclamation marks.

((&#10006;)) Don't call exclamation points exclamation marks!

=== Ellipses

Avoid ellipses. When referring to an ellipsis on text or buttons on the user interface,
remove the ellipsis in your instructions.

((&#10004;)) At the top of the page, select *File* > *Open*.

((&#10006;)) At the top of the page, select *File* > *Open...*.

=== End punctuation

Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and items in a list that aren't full sentences. Save the periods for paragraphs and body copy.


=== Quotation marks

In most content, use double quotation marks. In online content, use straight quotation marks (" "). In code examples, use straight quotation marks. In printed content, use curly quotation marks (“ ”) except in user input and code samples.



NOTE: Commas and periods go inside quotation marks. (This is the standard American style.)

Use single quotation marks (' ') in documentation in the these cases:

- In code examples, in languages that use single quotation marks.
- When nesting a quotation inside another quotation.

TIP: Don't use _scare quotes_. Scare quotes are quotation marks that writers place around a word or phrase to signal that they are using it in a nonstandard, ironic, or otherwise special sense.
They are also called shudder quotes or sneer quotes.

=== Ampersands

Avoid the ampersand (&) character unless it's part of a company name or brand name.
Don't use the ampersand in place of _and_ in text or headings unless referring to the symbol as it's displayed on the user interface.
You may use the ampersand when referencing its use in HTML or programming languages.

((&#10004;)) Ben & Jerry's

((&#10004;)) Smith & Wesson

((&#10006;)) Managing identification, authentication & authorization

((&#10006;)) The technical writers are friendly & approachable

TIP: Because space is limited in the user interface, the ampersand (&) character is often used in category names. For example, IKEA uses the product category _Beds & mattresses_ and Microsoft Windows has _Time & Language_ settings.

=== Commas

Place a comma after introductory words or phrases.

((&#10004;)) In 2024, {compname} reported a revenue of 15 million Euro.

((&#10004;)) As stated in our requirements, users must create a password with 15 characters or more.

((&#10004;)) To summarize, commas are a great way to increase readability.

Use a comma after or around the words _for example_.

((&#10004;)) The {compname} platforms use the latest encryption technology, for example, for storing patient data on the Personal Health Data Platform.

TIP: Don't use _for example_ and _and so on_ together because it's redundant. +
((&#10006;)) We support the most popular browsers, for example, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and so on.

Put a comma before the word _which_ at the start of a nonrestrictive clause.

((&#128065;)) See <<using-that-which-and-who-in-relative-clauses>>.

//Add link to section that explains relative clauses and which vs. that

//Add link to section about the serial comma

=== Dashes and hyphens

Use the en dash (–) to indicate spans of time and ranges of numbers.
Avoid the en dash with compound adjectives, use the hyphen.
Avoid the em dash.

To set off a word or phrase that interrupts or adds more information to a sentence, use spaced en dashes instead.

((&#10004;)) Bits 3–17

((&#10004;)) The scheduled downtime for our servers is 1:00–3:00. But preferably "1:00 to 3:00."

((&#10004;)) When to use – and not use – dashes

((&#10006;)) When to use—and not use—dashes

((&#10006;)) Desktop interface–specific instructions


//Link to rule to use "to" for ranges

TIP: En dashes can help you reduce parentheses in your writing – but use them sparingly.

=== Semicolons

Sentences containing semicolons are often complex and can be simplified.
Avoid semicolons or try replacing them with a period or a comma.


=== Multiplication signs

Use the multiplication sign (×), not the letter x, to indicate the mathematical operation or when referring to screen resolution or dimensions.

((&#10004;)) Your profile picture must at least be  80 × 80 pixels and in PNG format.


== Writing task topics and procedures

Tasks are the most common topic type for user assistance content.
Instructions consist of multiple steps formatted as a numbered list.
Use a front-loaded task heading to help users quickly find instructions.
In the heading, tell users what the instructions help them do.

If there's more than 1 way to do something, describe the best way.
Giving alternative ways can confuse users.

Apply these guidelines when writing procedures:

=== Topic headings

- Use the gerund in headings to ensure a parallel structure.

- Keep headings short and to the point. Place the important part at the beginning. This is called front-loading.

- Avoid having two headings in a row without text in between.

=== Short topic descriptions

- If you want to add some background information, start with a short description of no more than 2 or 3 sentences.
Your short description can also outline any prerequisites that must be met before the user begins.

=== Procedures in topics

- Introduce your procedure with a sentence that uses an infinitive phrase:
+
_To create awesome headings:_
- Use a separate numbered entry for each step.
- Use complete sentences with imperative verb forms.
- Capitalize the first word in each step and use a period at the end of each step.
- You can combine short steps that are displayed in the same place on the user interface.
- If it helps the user, consider adding a step result to procedure steps.
- Optional: Finish your procedure by stating the expected result.

=== Writing optional steps in procedures

For an optional step, use _Optional_ as the first word of the step, followed by a colon.

((&#10004;)) Optional: Select more documents to share with your doctor.

((&#10006;)) Option: Select more documents to share with your doctor.

((&#10006;)) Optionally, you can select more documents to share with your doctor.



== Bias-free communication

=== Gender neutrality

Avoid pronouns like _he_ and _his_ in references to a person whose gender is unknown.
Instead, rewrite to use the second person (you) or use plural.
You can also refer to a person's role (for example, user, employee, medical staff, or client), or just use _person_ or "individual."

TIP: The best option is to cast the reference into the plural or to reword so that no pronoun is needed.

The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, has a section about "Techniques for achieving gender neutrality."

See :books: _The Chicago Manual of Style_

((&#10006;)) Each user can store his or her encrypted health data on the {compname} platform.

((&#10004;)) Users can store their encrypted health data on the {compname} platform.

((&#10004;)) When you arrive at the test center, staff scans your QR code.

((&#10006;)) Each student is expected to choose the topic of his or her research paper before taking the midterm.

((&#10004;)) Students are expected to choose the topic of their research paper before they take the midterm.

((&#10004;)) Each student is expected to choose a research paper topic before taking the midterm.

It's a good idea to use a disclaimer like this:

((&#10004;)) We try not to use gender-specific word forms and formulations. As appropriate for context and readability, {compname} may use masculine word forms to refer to all genders.

=== Avoid terms that transport racial bias

==== Blacklist/Whitelist

Instead of blacklist and whitelist (as nouns and verbs), you can use the following:

- block list/allow list
- deny list/approved list
- unapproved list/approved list

((&#10004;)) Block lists help filter out spam messages before they reach your inbox.

==== Master/Slave

Don’t use master and slave to describe the relationship between 2 processes or hardware devices. Instead, use an alternative that’s appropriate for the context, such as the following:

- primary/subordinate
- primary/secondary
- primary/replica
- main/secondary
- publisher/subscriber
- host/client



== Adding cross-references

Cross-references are links to nonessential information that may help a user.
For the different types of cross-references, use these icons:

[horizontal]

((&#128065;)):: Information in another part of the same document or on our own website. When you refer to another section or topic, insert the section heading as an active link.

((&#10064;)):: External web link with information. Use the URL or choose descriptive link text. To ensure that the link works, click to test.

((&#128218;)):: Link to another document or information product. Set the title in italics.

Keep introductions to cross-references short.
In most cases, the word "see" is sufficient.

NOTE: To group your cross-references, you can use "Related topics" as a headline. Limit the number of cross-references under a topic to no more than 3.

For web addresses, it's best to link to an overview page instead of a technical specification because deep links on websites often change.

((&#10004;)) ((&#128065;)) See <<Writing-link-text-web-addresses-and-URLs>>

((&#10004;)) ((&#10064;)) See https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

((&#10004;)) :books: See _iPhone User Guide for iOS 12.3_

((&#10004;)) For more information, see <<Writing-link-text-web-addresses-and-URLs>>. (in some cases)

((&#10006;)) For more information, refer to the W3C website here https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

== Writing link text, web addresses, and URLs [[Writing-link-text-web-addresses-and-URLs]]

A link is any text or icon that users can select to go somewhere.
Links can direct users to other documents, other places within the same document, or other web pages.

Link text can take the following forms:

- A description of the linked-to content, capitalized with sentence style.
- The exact title of the linked-to content, capitalized the same way the title is capitalized.
- A URL or web address, written in lowercase.

Link text must indicate what the reader sees, or where they will be taken, after selecting it.
When writing link text, ensure it's clear without its surrounding text.

((&#10004;)) Read more about bats in the link:[Flying Mammals section].

((&#10004;)) For more on gameplay mechanics, refer to the link:[Settlers of Catan rulebook].

((&#10006;)) Read more about bats in the Flying Mammals link:[section].

((&#10006;)) To find out more about gameplay mechanics, link:[click the link].

TIP: Never use "click here" as link text.

TIP: _Learn more_ is the new _Click here_. Be more descriptive in the link text, unless you have no space. Just using _Learn more_ as link text has usability and accessibility issues.


=== Web addresses and URLs

Avoid writing web addresses as link text. If writing a web address is essential, follow these guidelines:

- In content for general audiences, use "address" or "web address" rather than uniform resource locator (URL).
For a technical audience, use "URL" and don't spell it out on its first mention.
- For clarity in technical content, include the protocol name with the URL, for example, HTTPS or FTP.
Some authoring tools, such as the AsciiDoc editor, automatically recognize this text as a link.
- Use the preposition _at_ followed by the address in lowercase.


((&#10004;)) Check out our new sports jackets at link:[https://www.data4life.care/en/sports/clothing/jackets].

((&#10006;)) On link:[HTTPS://www.data4life.care/EN/Sports/Clothing/Jackets], you can find our new sports jackets.

== Writing about the user interface

Writing about the user interface (UI) and describing user actions is the core element of user assistance writing.
Users interact with computer systems by using UI elements which initiate actions.
Developers call UI elements _controls_. Don't use _control_ in content for end users.

//Add link to the task topic part in this document here

=== Describing user interactions with the user interface

Users interact with our digital solutions using different input methods:

- Touch screen
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Voice

Use generic verbs that work with any input method.
Avoid input-specific verbs, such as _click_, _tap_, or _swipe_ if possible.
Instead, use verbs like _choose_ or _select_.

You can use _right-click_ when describing user input on computers when there's no alternative.

((&#10004;)) To continue, choose *Next*.

((&#10004;)) To download, select a photo, and choose *Download*.

((&#10006;)) To download, click on a photo.

=== Naming user interface elements

UI element descriptions have two parts:

- The _name_, which is displayed on the UI, for example, *Skip*.

- The _generic name_ – also called descriptor – that describes the element, for example, *Button*.

IMPORTANT: For English, the name is followed by the generic name. For German, it's the other way around.

==== Developer documentation and generic names

For clarity, always include the generic name with the element name in documentation.

These examples are names with their generic names (in bold) that are common in documentation for developers:

- <strong> *tag*
- curl *command*
- firstName *variable*
- fadeOut() *function*
- style *attribute*
- .click() *event*
- match() *method*
- myObject *object*
- length *property*
- Activity *class*
- undefined *state*
- GET *request*

In developer documentation, the name preceding the generic name is formatted as `code`.

((&#10004;)) The `lastName` variable has no value.

((&#10006;)) The variable `lastName` has no value.

((&#10004;)) The endpoint only accepts `POST` requests.

((&#10006;)) The command `curl` didn't execute.

==== User documentation and generic names

In most end user documentation, you can leave out the generic name. Unless you need to include the descriptor to avoid confusion.

These examples are names with their descriptors (in bold) that you see in documentation for users:

- File *menu*
- Save as *command*
- Home *tab*
- Back *button*
- I consent *checkbox*
- Menu *icon*

In user documentation, the name preceding the generic descriptor is formatted as *bold* (unlike in this list).

IMPORTANT: For English, the name is followed by the generic name. For German, it's the other way around.

((&#10004;)) To configure your settings, choose the *Menu* icon.

((&#10006;)) To configure your settings, choose the icon *Menu*.

((&#10004;)) On the *Overview* tab, move the cursor to the *Name* field using the *Tab* key.

NOTE: If a UI element name ends with an ellipsis (...), leave out the ellipsis in the description.

=== Commonly used user interface elements at {compname}

The link:https://storybook.d4l.io/[Data4Life component library] collects the UI elements for the web app.
In general, avoid talking about UI elements.
Most of the time, describe what users need to do.
In most cases, procedures can use names of UI elements and leave out the generic names. The table lists UI elements and the verbs and adjectives to use for them.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===

|===

IMPORTANT: For UI elements without interaction, use _is displayed_. It's OK to use the passive voice here because the actor is obvious. Avoid the following words: displays, appears, opens, or shows.

NOTE: For end user documentation, refer to unavailable commands and options on the UI as _unavailable_, not as _grayed out_, _dimmed_, _disabled_, or _inactive_. Google calls these commands _disabled_. Apple accepts disabled for developer content. Avoid _disabled_ in content for end users.

=== Sequence of user actions in procedures

To increase readability and to make texts easier to understand, follow these rules.

==== Write location before action

To ensure that users can easily follow procedures on the UI, write location before action.

((&#10004;)) Under the *Password* field, choose *Forgot password*.

((&#10004;)) On the *Sharing* tab, select the information that you want to share with your doctor, and choose *Start sharing*.

((&#10006;)) Choose *Start sharing* on the *Sharing* tab to select the information that you want to share with your doctor.


==== Write result before action

Write result (a user's goal) before action, and effect before cause.

((&#10004;)) To access your account, enter your PIN code.

((&#10004;)) To reset your password, choose *Forgot password*.

((&#10004;)) To show your password, in the *Login* dialog, in the *Password* field, choose the ((&#128065;))  Eye symbol.

((&#10006;)) Choose  *Forgot password* to reset your password.

((&#10006;)) You'll need to download the Chrome Remote Desktop app to use your mobile device for remote access.

((&#10006;)) You can change your avatar by clicking the *Avatar* button.

=== Shortcut: menu cascading

To refer to a location in the UI without writing a detailed procedure, use menu cascading. Don't use this by default, but when space is limited.

((&#10004;)) Choose *My profile > Account settings > Download my user data.*


=== Referring to user interface elements

Refer to common user interface elements in the following ways:

//Finalize this part

- Microsoft says about adjectives with checkboxes: Use check or checked as an adjective related to check boxes. Google and SAP: selected and unselected as adjectives, very common: checked and unchecked as main statuses.
- States of checkboxes: selected, cleared, indeterminate OR: checked, unchecked, indeterminate
- switch (Microsoft calls it toggle button), Google and Apple call it switch. Some also call it the toggle switch, Verb:

=== Google for Android

Check out Google material.io resources.

- *Bottom navigation bars* Bottom navigation bars allow movement between primary destinations (3 to 5) in an app (mobile or tablet only). They consist of a container with icons that have text labels. Icons in the bottom nativation bars can be active or inactive. (note difference with unavailable). States: active, inactive, focused or pressed.

- *Badges:* Bottom navigation icons can include badges in their upper right corner. These badges can contain dynamic information, such as a number of pending requests.

- *Top navigation bars:* Can contain menu icon (Hamburger), up arrow, back arrow, title, action items, and the overflow menu (3 dots)

- Snackbars
- Banners
- dialogs
- floating action buttons (FABs)
- Text button, Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:
In dialogs, In cards. In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.
- Outlined button: medium-emphasis buttons that display a stroke around a text label. They contain actions that are important, but aren’t the primary action in an app.
- Contained button, Contained buttons display a container around a text label. Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

=== Apple mobile UI terminology
- bottom navigation bars are called "tab bar" (but there also are "toolbars"). Apple says Use a tab bar strictly for navigation. Tab bar buttons should not be used to perform actions. If you need to provide controls that act on elements in the current view, use a toolbar instead. See Toolbars. original from the Apple website: TIP
It’s important to understand the difference between a tab bar and a toolbar, because both types of bars appear at the bottom of an app screen. A tab bar lets the user switch quickly between different sections of an app, such as the Alarm, Stopwatch, and Timer tabs in the Clock app. A toolbar contains buttons for performing actions related to the current context, like creating an item, deleting an item, adding an annotation, or taking a photo. See Toolbars. Tab bars and toolbars never appear together in the same view.





== Writing about files, file types, and file formats

When you write about files, follow these guidelines:

- Use the formal name of the file type.
- The file type names are in all caps, because many file type names are abbreviations.
- Be as specific as you can be when referring to filenames.

((&#10004;)) Share the PDF file with your doctor

((&#10006;)) Share the .pdf file with your doctor

((&#10004;)) Import the APK file

((&#10006;)) Import the .apk file

Avoid the filename extension to refer generically to the file type.

((&#10004;)) Upload the TIFF file from your smartphone

((&#10006;)) Upload the .tif file from your smartphone


NOTE: Use "file format" only when you refer to the file structure and the method of storing data. Otherwise, use "file type."

Consider spelling out the abbreviations, unless your audience is familiar with a file type.

((&#10004;)) Create a Bash script for the task

((&#10006;)) Create an .sh script for the task

Use lowercase for filename extensions.

((&#10004;)) Your folder now contains the setup.exe file

((&#10006;)) Your folder now contains the setup.EXE file

Include the period when specifically referring to the filename extension.

((&#10004;)) When you rename a file, don't change its filename extension, for example, .md.


== Writing key names and keyboard shortcuts

When you write about the keyboard, follow these guidelines:

Use recognized key name abbreviations.

((&#10004;)) Press Esc

((&#10006;)) Press Escape

Separate keys using + with spaces when writing combinations.

((&#10004;)) Press Cmd (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + V

((&#10004;)) Press Cmd(⌘)+Shift(⇧)+V

Start each key name with a capital letter.

((&#10004;)) You can copy text by pressing Cmd (⌘) + C.

((&#10006;)) You can copy text by pressing Cmd + c.

If a key name includes a symbol, write the key name followed by its symbol in parenthesis.

((&#10004;)) Press Ctrl (^) + Plus (+)

((&#10006;)) Press Ctrl + Plus

Unless writing about Mac or Windows keyboards alone, include key names for both. Separate them with a slash.

((&#10004;)) Press Option/Alt (⌥) + Tab

((&#10006;)) Press Alt (⌥) + Tab

When shortcuts for Mac and Windows keyboards differ, include both.

((&#10004;)) To copy the text, press Cmd (⌘) + C on Mac or Ctrl (^) + C on Windows.

((&#10006;)) To copy the text, press Ctrl (^) + C.

NOTE: Call the key with the Windows logo the Windows logo key.

== Appendix

This appendix compiles tables that help you write concise and according to your documentation style.

=== Avoid the following words and phrases

To avoid wordiness, use simple, common words and phrases.
The table gives examples of verbs or phrasing that you can simplify.
