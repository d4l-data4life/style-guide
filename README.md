# Technical writing style guide

The technical writing style guide provides guidelines for writing technical documentation and user assistance content at Data4Life.

Though this document is intended for technical writers, it includes many rules and best practices for general writing in English. Therefore, we encourage anybody who wishes to make use of it to do so.

We made every effort to ensure that this document fulfills its intended use, but we welcome your feedback and will consider it in future updates.
